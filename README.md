# helping online communities grow
## tetsudai – a japanese word meaning 'helper'

Hi! My name is Adrian, aka aidswidjaja, and I'm a 15yo boy from Sydney, Australia. I've done lots of things online, from just casually hanging out on internet forums, YouTube, Discord and reddit, particularly in the technology, anime and gaming communities, but in recent times I've also taken up more active positions. I've been on Discord's online peer support communities since mid 2019, and in my tenure have been working with server owners, either through my initial role as a very active supporter, or towards where I am now, where I do what I can to help out.

***

With respect to online support communities, I have experience in many areas, including:
- collaborating with others to reach goals
- working as a supporter on different online support communities, either as a staff member, distinguished member, or just your regular friendly internet stranger
- acting as a liaison between the people I meet online and authorities including Discord's Trust and Safety Team by communicating professionally and in the best interests of our communities
- provding technical services for different online support communities, including the [Lively Discord website](https://livelydiscord.netlify.com) and currently working on the [Healing Hub Discord website](https://github.com/tetsudai/HealingHub)

I'm particularly interested in starting initiatives that bring communities together, bridge the gaps between isolationism, and overall help people to a better place. Support groups, community relationships and better systems and processes within online communities are things I am foucsing my attention on for the future.

With respect to anything related to technology and computers, I'm a jack of all trades, from hardware and low-level software to high level programming, and anything in between, including, but definietly not limited to:
- video games, including playing them (duh), being on the bleeding edge, and even some legally questionable ROM stuff haha
- high level programming (HTML, git, Python, some JavaScript, a bit of Dart) and almost anything covered in the [NSW SDD curriculum](https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/11-12/stage-6-learning-areas/technologies/software-design-development)
- low level stuff ([calculator hacking!](https://tinyurl.com/fxesplus-convert))
- Android unlocking and rooting
- experience with macOS, Windows, Linux, Unix, POSIX, including great familiarity with the command line 
- servers, networking, and almost anything covered in the [NSW IPT curriculum](https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/11-12/stage-6-learning-areas/technologies/information-processes-technology-syllabus)
- a lot of experience on internet communities and such, from big ones like YouTube and reddit, to smaller ones like individual Discord servers or internet forums

I'm still not sure where to from here, but I know a little bit of everything.

With respect to anime, well, I watch anime. And I'm thinking of joining MAL Rewrite, do you think I should go for it?

## What is tetsudai?

tetusdai – a japanese word meaning 'helper'

It's not really anything - apart from being a GitHub organization and a internet handle I use when referring to any projects I work on in the interests of the wider Internet. If you're interested in making the Internet a better place too, you can call yourself part of the tetsudai project too, I guess!

Overall, I hope this gives you a good idea of tetsudai and what I envision my future online to be. If you have any questions/enquiries/whatevers you want to talk about, hit me up on Discord (aidswidjaja#2805), Reddit ([u/airswidjaja](https://reddit.com/u/airswidjaja) or any of my other contact methods listed at my personal website, [aidswidjaja.github.io](https://aidswidjaja.github.io). My PMs are always open, so feel free to say hi!
